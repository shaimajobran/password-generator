# Password Generator
``
I am able to radomly generate a password that is more secure

# what I Did  using java script:
WHEN I click the button to generate a password, I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria, I am able to select which criteria to include in the password uppercase ,special character ,lowercase or numeric

WHEN prompted for the length of the password, I am able to choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password, I am able to choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt, my input is validated and at least one character type is selected

WHEN all prompts are answered ,a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

AND when  the password is generated it is written to the page.
